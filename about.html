          <h3>Bio</h3>
          <p>
            I&#39;m L. My full name isn&#39;t important, and if you think
            you&#39;ve figured it out, you&#39;re probably wrong. I work as a
            private detective, though most of my clients never meet me face to
            face. I prefer to operate from behind the scenes where emotion
            doesn&#39;t cloud judgment and truth can be dissected logically.
          </p>
          <p>
            I&#39;ve handled cases that governments couldn&#39;t solve, crimes
            that seemed impossible, and people who believed they couldn&#39;t be
            caught. I don&#39;t rely on luck or intuition only evidence,
            deduction, and a clear mind.

          <h3>Area of Low Confidence</h3>
          <p>
            Despite what people assume, I&#39;m not confident in my ability to
            understand emotions, my own or others&#39;. Logic can explain
            patterns of behavior, but not the feelings behind them. I can
            predict what someone will do, but not always why they do it. That
            uncertainty bothers me more than I care to admit.

          <h3>Note to Future Self</h3>
          <p>
            If you&#39;re reading this, it means you&#39;ve solved another case
             or lost one. Either way, you&#39;re still alive, which means
            there&#39;s more work to do.
          </p>
          <p>
            Remember that intellect is only valuable when it serves truth, not
            pride. Don&#39;t let the pursuit of being right replace the pursuit
            of what&#39;s real. You&#39;ve seen what obsession can do, even to
            the smartest minds. Stay detached, but not hollow.

              People often mistake intelligence for clarity. The truth is, the
              smarter you become, the more you realize how uncertain everything
              really is. Every answer leads to more questions, and every truth
              has layers. Certainty is comforting, but it&#39;s rarely honest.
